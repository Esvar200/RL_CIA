# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of different Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms applied to grid-based environments and a Bandit problem. The goal is to showcase various RL techniques such as Value Iteration (Dynamic Programming), Q-Learning, SARSA, and a K-armed Bandit solution. The code is organized into two Jupyter notebooks: `RL_CIA_1.ipynb` for the Bandit problem and `RL_CIA_2.ipynb` for the grid-based problem.

## Overview

This repository includes two primary RL algorithms:

- **K-Armed Bandit Problem** (RL_CIA_1.ipynb): A simple exploration-exploitation scenario where the agent must maximize its reward by selecting one of several slot machines (arms) with different reward distributions.
- **Grid-Based RL Problem** (RL_CIA_2.ipynb): An environment where an agent navigates a grid with obstacles to reach a goal, comparing different algorithms like Value Iteration (Dynamic Programming), Q-Learning, and SARSA.
